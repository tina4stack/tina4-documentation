# Tina4 - This is not a framework



## Overview
Tina4 is the result and culmination of more than 15 years of working with scripted languages where strong typing and coding practices have been left entirely to each developer who writes the code.

Whilst not being a framework it is a structural paradigm for developers to follow in writing their code, keeping the language the hero and the code maintainable.

## Quick Start
Use one of the following docker methods to try out Tina4 without having to install anything to your system

<!--codeinclude-->
[Python](./code-snippets/docker-run-python.sh)
<!--/codeinclude-->

<!--codeinclude-->
[PHP](./code-snippets/docker-run-php.sh)
<!--/codeinclude-->

## Philosophy
As we work out solutions for various languages where possible we have included libraries which add low impact to the code.  To this end our "framework" attempts to use and follow these basic principles.

- Green coding - the best code is no code
- Use of IDE vs Text Editors - good tools are essential for good code
- Use of a source code repository - the ability to track code changes and work effictively in a team 
- Package Management - write modules and libraries where possible for reuse
- Light Database Abstractions - most database abstractions are bloated and overengineered
- Database Migrations - database changes are treated as code
- Templated HTML - promotes reuse and good html structures
- Localization - support for different languages
- Environment variables - Use of .env files to declare global constants
- Inline Testing - tests live where the code is written
- Inline Documentation - documentation is done whilst coding
- Built in webserver - development environment replications the production experience
- Structured code - sustainable code through defined structure
- The language is the hero - promote using the language not the framework!

Tina4 is heavily opinionated, whilst it does not define how you should use it with a language, if you don't understand the paradigm you'd be best off using a framework.
