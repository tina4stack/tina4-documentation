## What's new

**v3.13.39 (2026-06-21)** - [full notes](/python/36-releases.md)

Auto-run migrations on startup (`TINA4_AUTO_MIGRATE`), a unified first-class `critical` log level, fail-loud ORM contracts (`save`, `create`, and `QueryBuilder` stop swallowing errors), and per-route WebSocket authentication on the upgrade. Plus a uniform `TINA4_` env manifest, an `Api` client that strips auth headers on cross-origin redirects, and sharper `tina4 metrics` coverage detection. Breaking: `critical` is now a top-level severity, and on Node.js `TINA4_CORS_CREDENTIALS` now defaults to `false`.

**v3.13.38 (2026-06-19)** - Coordinated security and robustness release. The WebSocket and SSE backplane is wired for real with an origin allow-list and idle reaper, a SOAP DTD reject and a GraphQL depth guard close the XML and query-depth attack surfaces, `htmlElement` escapes child content, and the new `tina4 metrics` command reports the top code-health offenders.

**Highlights since v3.12.3** - the v3.13 line unified the cache backend (memory, file, redis, valkey, memcached, mongodb, database), gave queues a full lifecycle (priority pop, retry backoff, automatic dead-lettering), added a request-scoped query cache, shipped live dev tooling over WebSocket and the `/__dev/mcp` endpoint, hardened the ORM and database layer to fail loud, and ran a broad security pass. See the [full release notes](/python/36-releases.md) for every version.

## How Tina4 reads

Pick a language. Each book stands on its own: you can read Python cover-to-cover, then pick up the PHP book later and recognise every pattern.

- **[Understanding Tina4](/general/index.md)** - Architecture, philosophy, the four-language promise. Read this first if you want the why.
- **[Python](/python/index.md)** - The reference implementation. Every feature lands here first.
- **[Node.js](/nodejs/index.md)** - TypeScript-first, native `node:http`, file-based routing, ESM-only.
- **[PHP](/php/index.md)** - PHP 8.5, `stream_select` server, zero composer deps in core.
- **[Ruby](/ruby/index.md)** - Rack 3, Puma in production, WEBrick in dev.
- **[tina4-js](/js/index.md)** - The 1.5 KB reactive frontend. Signals, Web Components, router, API client, WebSocket, PWA, SSE.
- **[Delphi](/delphi/index.md)** - FireMonkey cross-platform, FireDAC, REST client, and Twig templates.

Every book has a printable PDF with a clickable table of contents. Every chapter stays in sync with the code: release notes, version numbers, and example output are regenerated with every point release.
